## What is Markdown?
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. 
Created by [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world’s most popular markup languages.

You can add Markdown formatting elements to a plaintext file using a text editor application. 
Or you can use one of the many Markdown applications for macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android operating systems. 
There are also several web-based applications specifically designed for writing in Markdown.

Depending on the application you use, you may not be able to preview the formatted document in real time. 
But that’s okay. According to Gruber, Markdown syntax is designed to be readable and unobtrusive, 
so the text in Markdown files can be read even if it isn’t rendered.

## Why MDX?

[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/docs/what-is-mdx/) takes Markdown a step further and allows you to use JSX in your markdown content. 
You can import components, such as interactive charts or alerts, and embed them within your content. 
This makes writing long-form content with components a blast. 🚀

Version 2 of MDX was released after years of hard work, and has many improvements. Here are the highlights:

* 📝 Improved syntax makes it easier to use markdown in JSX
* 🧑‍💻 JavaScript expressions turn {2 * Math.PI} into 6.283185307179586
* 🔌 New esbuild, Rollup, and Node.js integrations
* ⚛️ Any JSX runtime: React, Preact, Vue, Emotion, you name it, they’re all supported
* 🌳 Improved AST exposes more info in greater detail
* 🏃‍♀️ Compiles at least 25% faster
* 🚴 Generated code runs twice as fast (100% faster)
* 🚄 Bundle size of @mdx-js/mdx is more than three times as small (250% smaller)
* 🧵 …and much, [so much more](https://mdxjs.com/blog/v2/)
